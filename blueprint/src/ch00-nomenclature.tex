\chapter{Nomenclature and Scope}

\section{Terminology}

This document uses two complementary names for the same underlying technology:

\subsection{AMT Protocol (Technical Name)}

\textbf{AMT} (Autonomous Meta-Trust) is the \emph{technical name} for the protocol, designed for international standardization. This is the name used in technical discussions, standards bodies, and peer-reviewed literature.

\subsection{AMATELUS (Marketing Name)}

\textbf{AMATELUS} is the \emph{marketing name}, indicating "Japanese origin." This is used for brand identity, commercial deployment, and public communication in Japan.

\subsection{Relationship}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{AMT Protocol} = international-standard-oriented technical specification
  \item \textbf{AMATELUS} = Japan-specific implementation and deployment brand
  \item Both refer to the same underlying cryptographic authentication mechanism
\end{itemize}

\section{Document Scope}

This blueprint covers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The AMT Protocol (technical foundation)
  \item The did:amt DID Method Specification (standardized identifier format)
  \item AMATELUS implementation guidance (Japan-specific deployment)
  \item Cryptographic foundations and formal proofs
\end{itemize}
